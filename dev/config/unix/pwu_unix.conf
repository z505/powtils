# FIRST LINE OF THIS FILE MUST contain the path to the DSO (DLL). Spaces in the 
# path are not recommended. The defualt above is LOCAL, i.e. upload the DSO to 
# your local directory you are running the cgi program in. Note the ./ on unix.
#
# Optimally, you will want to share te DSO among programs, so upload the
# DSO to your CGI-BIN directory somewere global, such as cgi-bin/libraries/psp/
# Once you have done that, set the above path to your cgi bin directory where
# you placed the DSO.  If you want to use an absolute path, you may have to 
# contact your host to find out the path to your server account. You can also 
# use relative paths, which is more scalable than absolute paths if you need
# to change servers or web hosts some day.
#
# If most of your cgi programs reside in /cgi-bin/somedir/ then the relative
# path can be reused over and over again. If you have programs in 
# /cgi-bin/somedir/subdir/ in those program directories, whereas an absolute 
# path stays constant all the time. The relative path is more tedious to setup 
# if you have complicated directory structures in cgi-bin, but it is webhost
# independent.

# or relative path for your session table here. The file will be created
# automatically, you just have to ensure that it: 1) can be created, 2) can be 
# read, 3) can be written - by your PWU apps. Otherwise PWU will attempt to 
# create it in your system temp directory (%WINDIR%\Temp\pspsess.sds on Windows 
# and /tmp/pspsess.sds on UNIX). 

# However, a local session/ or sds/ directory is  prefered.. for example the 
# below default sets the path to the local folder your cgi program resides in. 
# Storing sessions in TMP is insecure and hard to debug if anything goes wrong 
# with file locking. Storing sessions in a local session/ directory (or in 
# PasForum the sds/ directory) is much more secure and easier to debug if the 
# server crashes and the seesion file isn't unlocked. If a server crashes and 
# session isn't unlocked by pwu file locking mechanism, you must delete the 
# files in the session directory, which is much easier if you have a local 
# session/ directory. You cannot check /tmp/ over ftp easily, but you can easily 
# check a local session/ directory.
