 At this point, Security is not handled in the configuration file, but rather
 in the actual programming.  This is to discourage users from being able to 
 easily set security to 0 and program away, like many do with "magic" settings
 in PHP INI files - then their website gets hacked, and they wonder why.

 Basic XSS injection protection is handled in the pwmain.pas unit automatically
 by default, and html injection through forms or cgi variables is also handled
 automatically.
 
 However, because PWU is more secure, it means some characters may get chopped
 out without warning. Characters such as . / @#$^% will get chopped and replaced
 with zeros (so you know), unless you bypass the security system. It is easy to
 bypass the security system by choosing the custom  functions that allow you
 to specify no security, specify filtering, etc.

 Level 2 Security is used by default. The way it works behind the scenes, is 
 that the wrapper functions pass number 2 to the _S and _SF suffix functions. 
 You don't actually use the _S and _SF functions directly when doing regular web 
 programming. But if you ever need custom security, you can stop using 
 the wrapper functions like WebFormat, and start using  WebFormat_S. Likewise, 
 use GetCGIVar_S instead of GetCGIVar if you want custom security levels. 
 
 To bypass level 2 security, use functions with the _S and_SF prefix directly 
 (i.e. WebFormat_S), where you can specify level 0 to turn off all security per
 function that allows it.

 In other words, automatic security is on, and manual security controlled
 by the programmer's choice of functions, not by setting a global variable.
 Many times, the programmer will want security partially on for certain 
 functions, and completely on for other ones, due to different filtering 
 requirements. It is good to get into the habit of programming web applications 
 with default security on all the time, to protect yourself automatically. 

 In the worse case scenario, all that could happen is that your web forum, web
 site, article posting, (or whatever web application you are building) will not 
 output some back slashes, pipe characters, or other funny characters. When this 
 happens you see zeros on the screen in place of those bad characters.. and it
 therefore notifies you right there and then that your application needs
 filtering such as HtmlFilter function and friends. Change the code to allow
 those special symbols in on certain functions only - just bypass the security
 for your special case. But most of the time you do not want these symbols
 coming in and being output, since they can be dangerous.
 
 It is far better to be automatically protected than it is to be not protected 
 at all.  In web scripting languages (asp, php, perl) and websnap, where 
 very little protection (used to) exist, sites got/get hacked every day.

 You do not want to be programming hours and hours of security implementations
 over and over again on each web program, plus it will bloat up your code with 
 noise. So Powtils security allows you to focus on your web application
 development instead of you always implementing, coding, bloating source files,
 and worryingabout every incoming variable's security! The downside is that
 sometimes you may see some characters chopped out that you wanted in - all you
 need to do is choose the correct function and bypass security, if this happens.

 Example:
  Security in web programming is not fixed and does not stay the same throughout 
  a program. One may want to allow html symbols as input for a
  web forum's "post message" edit box,  but not allow html symbols 
  in the web forum's "user name" input box. 
  
  For this reason, you use functions with _S and _SF suffixes only when you need
  to bypass the default security level of 2.
  
  A common example of where Powtils protects you is if you have a URL such as:
  http://yoursite/cgi-bin/article?page=1
  
  If you display PAGE 1 on your webpage, your website is vulnerable to attacks
  in other programming environments. But Powtils protects the PAGE variable from
  being injected with javascript and other malicious input. It lets the "1" in
  and alphabit characters in by default.. and not characters like slashes, dots,
  null characters, etc. If you want slashes, dots, and other special characters
  coming in, then use GetCgiVar_S('page', 0)

Level 2
  The highest level of security for a function, protecting from 
  cross site scripting (XSS) and malicioius input
  DEFAULT LEVEL

Level 0
  No security, your own custom security. Use this when you are 
  implementing your own filtering methods, or when you are using 
  the FilterHTML function. 
  
  
Example of why you would need Level 0 security:

  You may have a special website that lets administrators insert dollar symbols 
  into your store database for dollar pricing, or something similar.

  Usually a dollar symbol as input is a malicious attempt, and is insecure. So 
  it is trimmed (deleted) or replaced with an HTML equivilent symbol by default. 
  But in a special case like a shopping cart database, where administrators may 
  be updating pricing with dollar signs at a website not open to the public 
  (secure intranet) you would want to allow the dollar symbol in as a true 
  dollar symbol character. You can therefore use Level 0, and implement your own 
  filtering and checking, such as letting dollar signs in but no other special 
  characters.
  
  Again these are rare cases, so usually default security is what you will be 
  using. In the above example, you would be better off just designing your 
  database so that it doesn't need actual dollar symbol input.. but if it DOES, 
  that is okay. You will only be bypassing default security in those special 
  situations with level 0, using the _SF and _S suffix functions in pwu.pp. 
  (pass 0 as one of the Security parameters)

Future consideration:
  The default security level could be defined as a global variable. 

For example  


   begin
     PWU_SECURITY:= OFF; // temporarily disable security
     x:= GetCgiVar('forumpost'); // allow some malicious characters in,
     CustomFilter(x);         // because they will be custom filtered here

     //now we need to set the security back on again for normal everyday stuff
     PWU_SECURITY:= ON 
     GetCgiVar('page');      // automatically protect from malicious characters
     GetCgiVar('category');  // ...
     GetCgiVar('productid'); // ...
   end;  
  
  The only issue with having a global variable is if people set it to low 
  security all the time and get into bad habits. The other option is to have a 
  global pwu config file variable - but this may encourage folks to set
  the security off all the time, and program in low security settings.
